Here’s a clean, sane pricing model for SharpSend that maps to integrations, pixel loads, CDN, and AI token use—plus an add-on “credits” system so heavy users can top up without jumping tiers.
Metered dimensions (what we count)
Tracked events: email pixel loads + link click redirects
CDN bandwidth: GB served for images/pixel
AI tokens: used for copy generation, subject lines, variants, summaries
Connectors: basic vs. premium integrations
Seats & SLA: user count and support level
Suggested tiers (monthly, annual -10% optional)
Starter — $99
100k tracked events
5 GB CDN
1M AI tokens
2 seats
2 basic connectors (e.g., Brevo, Mailchimp, SendGrid, SES)
90-day analytics retention
Overage: $0.60 per +100k events, $0.12/GB, $6 per +1M tokens
Growth — $399
2M tracked events
50 GB CDN
5M AI tokens
5 seats
5 connectors (incl. any 1 premium: HubSpot/Marketo/or SFMC)
12-month retention
Overage: $0.50 per +100k events, $0.10/GB, $5 per +1M tokens
Pro — $999
10M tracked events
250 GB CDN
20M AI tokens
15 seats
All connectors (premium included)
SSO (SAML), audit logs, priority support, 24-month retention
Overage: $0.45 per +100k events, $0.08/GB, $4 per +1M tokens
Enterprise — custom
50M+ events, 1TB+ CDN, 100M+ tokens
Private cluster/VPC options, custom SLAs, bespoke pricing
Volume overage discounts
Add-ons (“Credits” device)
AI Credit Packs (prepaid): $40 = 10M tokens; $180 = 50M; $320 = 100M
(Applied before overage; great for campaign spikes.)
Extra Premium Connector (Growth): +$200/mo each (Marketo, SFMC, HubSpot)
Extra Seats: $15/user/mo (Starter/Growth), $10/user/mo (Pro)
Vanity tracking domain: $25/mo (per domain)
Data retention extension: +$50/mo per extra 6 months (Starter/Growth)
Priority support (if not in plan): $400/mo
Why this works
Event-based pricing aligns with your value (optimization + analytics) regardless of where emails are sent.
CDN & tokens are the variable cost drivers; bundling some into tiers keeps bills predictable.
Add-on credits prevent forced tier jumps during spikes.
Back-of-napkin for your earlier scenario
300,000 emails/day pulling an image
Pixel loads/month: 300,000 × 30 = 9,000,000 events
(fits inside Pro’s 10M)
CDN bandwidth (example): assume ~30 KB per image
9,000,000 × 30 KB = 270,000,000 KB = 270,000 MB = 270 GB
(Pro includes 250 GB → 20 GB overage)
Click redirects: if CTR ≈ 3%, clicks ≈ 270,000 (already counted in “events” if you include them)
AI usage (if generating copy): a 1,000-word draft typically runs ~2,000–3,000 tokens end-to-end.
100 drafts/month ≈ 200k–300k tokens (well within Growth/Pro bundles).
Estimated bill (with those assumptions):
Pro plan: $999
CDN overage: 20 GB × $0.08 ≈ $1.60
Events: under 10M → no event overage
AI: depends on your workflow; likely within the 20M included (or use prepaid credits).
Total ≈ $1,000–$1,100/mo before any optional add-ons.
Notes on integrations
Basic connectors: Brevo, Mailchimp, SendGrid, SES, Klaviyo, ActiveCampaign.
Premium connectors: Salesforce Marketing Cloud (ExactTarget), HubSpot, Marketo.
(Priced up because they need heavier support and ongoing API maintenance.)
