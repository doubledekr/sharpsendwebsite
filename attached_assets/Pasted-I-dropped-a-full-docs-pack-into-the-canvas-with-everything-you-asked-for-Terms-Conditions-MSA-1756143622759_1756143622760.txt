I dropped a full docs pack into the canvas with everything you asked for:

* Terms & Conditions (MSA-style, with the safer Performance Promise language baked in)
* API docs (auth, rate limits, pixels, click redirects, Events & Conversions APIs, reporting, webhooks, connectors)
* Integrations & Features overview (basic vs. premium ESP/CRM connectors, compliance/deliverability, security, scalability)
* About, Contact, and Careers pages (ready to paste into your site)
* 3 blog drafts:

  1. Do AI-Written Subject Lines Actually Lift Results in 2024–2025?
  2. How to Prove Newsletter Revenue Lift in 90 Days (Holdout Method)
  3. New Gmail/Yahoo Sender Rules: What Publishers Need (and How SharpSend Helps)

If you want, I can add a Privacy Policy + DPA summary + SLA as a follow-on.

Want me to tailor the T\&C to Delaware law, or swap in your corporate details (legal name, address, contact emails) so it’s publish-ready?
