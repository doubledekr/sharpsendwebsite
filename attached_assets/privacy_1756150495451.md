# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** August 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **SharpSend, Inc.** ("SharpSend," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information in connection with our websites, apps, APIs, and services (the "Service"). This policy distinguishes between data we process **as a controller** (e.g., your account and billing info) and **as a processor** on behalf of our customers (e.g., end‑user pixel, click, and conversion events). By using the Service, you agree to this Policy.

## 1) Roles & Scope
- **Controller:** We act as a controller for **Account, Billing, Site Visitor, and Marketing** data.
- **Processor:** We act as a processor for **End‑User Event Data** that customers capture via our pixels, redirects, SDKs, and APIs. Customers are the controllers for this data and define the purposes of processing.

## 2) Categories of Information We Process
- **Account & Billing (Controller):** name, email, role, company, login metadata, seats, plan info, invoices, payment tokens (stored by our PCI‑compliant processor), support tickets.
- **Integration Settings (Controller/Processor):** connector settings, API keys/OAuth tokens (stored encrypted at rest), field mappings.
- **End‑User Event Data (Processor):** message/campaign/deck IDs, pseudonymous user IDs, timestamps, IP address and coarse geolocation, user agent, UTM parameters, referral data, clickthrough URLs, conversion details (order value, currency, order_id, item SKUs/qty). **Avoid** placing sensitive data in URLs or metadata.
- **Technical Logs (Controller):** request IDs, error traces, performance metrics.
- **Job Applicants (Controller):** resume details, links you provide, and communications.
- **Cookies/Similar Tech:** session, preferences, and analytics cookies (see Cookie Notice below).

## 3) Sources
- Directly from you (sign‑up, support, sales, career applications).
- Automatically through pixels, redirects, SDKs, cookies/local storage, and logs.
- From third‑party platforms you authorize (ESPs/CRMs/ecommerce/analytics).

## 4) How We Use Information
- Provide and operate the Service; measure attribution and revenue.
- Secure the platform; detect/prevent fraud and abuse.
- Customer support; service communications and product updates.
- Improve features, models, and performance using de‑identified/aggregated data.
- Billing, accounting, compliance with law.
- Limited B2B marketing to business contacts (opt‑out any time).

**EEA/UK legal bases:** contract, legitimate interests (product improvement, security, B2B marketing), consent (optional cookies/trackers), and legal obligation (tax, accounting).

## 5) Sharing & Disclosures
- **Vendors/Sub‑processors:** cloud hosting, CDN, logging/monitoring, error tracking, communications, and payments—bound by contract.
- **Integrations you enable:** we exchange data with your ESP/CRM/commerce tools as configured by you.
- **Affiliates/Corporate events:** mergers, acquisitions, or asset transfers.
- **Legal/Compliance:** to comply with law, enforce terms, or protect rights and safety.
- **Aggregated/De‑identified:** benchmarks and usage stats that do not identify a person.

## 6) International Transfers
Data may be processed in the United States and other countries. Where required, we rely on **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** and implement supplementary safeguards.

## 7) Retention
Default analytics retention: **Starter 90 days**, **Growth 12 months**, **Pro 24 months**, configurable for Enterprise. Backups typically persist up to **35 days**. Account records are retained as required by law. Upon termination, export is available for 30 days; deletion follows within commercially reasonable time.

## 8) Your Rights & Choices
Depending on your location, you may have rights to **access, correct, delete, restrict**, or **port** your data; to **object** to processing; and to withdraw consent. 
- For **End‑User Event Data** we process as a **processor**, contact the applicable customer/controller.
- For your account or site‑visitor data, email **privacy@sharpsend.io**. We’ll respond within 30–45 days, or as required by law. We may verify your identity and may deny requests where permitted by law. Appeals are handled via **privacy@sharpsend.io**.

## 9) US State Disclosures (CPRA/CPA/CTDPA/others)
- We do **not** "sell" personal information and do **not** "share" it for cross‑context behavioral advertising as defined by CPRA. We use analytics to improve our Service.
