# Security & Trust

Your data’s safety and integrity are core to SharpSend. Below is a high‑level overview of our security program. A detailed whitepaper and security questionnaire are available under NDA on request.

## Program & Governance
- Security owned by the **CTO** with quarterly reviews at the executive level.
- Policies cover access control, acceptable use, incident response, vendor risk, and secure SDLC.
- Employees complete background checks (as permitted) and annual security training.

## Data Protection
- **Encryption in transit:** TLS 1.2+ with HSTS; modern ciphers.
- **Encryption at rest:** AES‑256 for databases, volumes, and backups.
- **Key management:** Cloud KMS/HSM; rotation and separation of duties.
- **Secrets management:** Dedicated secrets manager; no secrets in code; periodic rotation.
- **Tenant isolation:** Logical separation by account; scoped API keys; org‑level RBAC.

## Application Security
- **Authentication:** Email/password (argon2id hashing with per‑user salt + server‑side pepper); optional **2FA**; **SSO (SAML/OIDC)** for Pro/Enterprise.
- **Authorization:** Role‑based access control; least‑privilege service accounts; **audit logs** for sensitive actions.
- **Session security:** Short‑lived tokens; refresh token rotation; device logout.
- **Input & transport hardening:** Validation/escaping; CSRF protection; strict rate limiting and bot protection at the edge.
- **Security headers:** CSP, HSTS, X‑Content‑Type‑Options, Referrer‑Policy.
- **Webhooks:** HMAC‑SHA256 signatures (`X-SS-Signature`) over raw payload with replay protections.

## Secure SDLC & Vulnerability Management
- Peer code reviews; branch protection; Infrastructure‑as‑Code scanning.
- **SAST/DAST** and dependency scanning with SBOM tracking.
- Patch SLAs: **Critical ≤ 7 days**, **High ≤ 30 days**, **Medium ≤ 90 days**.
- **Pen tests:** Annual independent penetration test; remediation tracked to closure.
- **Responsible disclosure:** Email **security@sharpsend.io**; PGP key posted on /security; safe‑harbor language provided.

## Infrastructure & Operations
- Reputable cloud provider with **ISO 27001**/**SOC 2**/**PCI‑DSS** certified data centers.
- Network segmentation (VPC/VNET); WAF/DDoS protection; hardened base images.
- **Monitoring & alerts:** Centralized logs/metrics/traces with 24/7 on‑call.
- **Backups & DR:** Encrypted backups; periodic restore tests; targets **RPO ≤ 24h** and **RTO ≤ 24h** (tunable for Enterprise).
- **Business continuity:** Runbooks for failover; capacity planning and load testing.

## Data Lifecycle
- **Collection:** Only what’s necessary for attribution and reporting.
- **Minimization:** Avoid sensitive fields in URLs/metadata; PII redaction where feasible.
- **Retention:** Plan‑based defaults (Starter 90d, Growth 12m, Pro 24m) with custom policies for Enterprise.
- **Export/Deletion:** Admin export via API/UI; deletion within 30 days of verified request or contract termination (subject to legal holds and backup windows).

## Compliance & Privacy
- Privacy program aligned with **GDPR/UK GDPR** and **CPRA** principles.
- **DPA with SCCs** available; current sub‑processors listed at **/legal/subprocessors**.
- We are not a broker‑dealer or investment adviser.

## Customer Responsibilities
- Maintain SPF/DKIM/DMARC, List‑Unsubscribe, and consent flows in your ESP/website.
- Keep API keys and OAuth tokens secret; rotate credentials regularly.
- Configure conversion tracking responsibly; avoid sensitive data in URLs.
- Use SSO/2FA and strong password practices for all users.

## Incident Response
If we become aware of a security incident that materially affects your data, we will notify impacted customers **without undue delay**, and, where required by law (e.g., GDPR), within **72 hours** of becoming aware, including known details and remediation steps.
